My Brand Shop project is used for E-Commerce Operations. To make this Project I have used React.js with CSS Framework Tailwind & daiusyui. For Authentication, I have used Firebase.

In this Project, a user can use some functionality. I am describing it Below: 

- A user can see our Brands Shop, About us, FAQ Section;
- A user can easily redirect from one page to another by using Navbar.
- To see the particular Car Details a user needs to log themselves to our website.
- A user can manually register with email, name, photo URL & password.
- After successful registration user can log in to see the car details and add to the Cart.
- After Add to Cart user can see their Add to Cart product in the My Cart section. 
- User can also log in with their existing Google account.
